## To view the analysis
The report is available at ['Is loneliness linked to the availability of a local university?'](https://www.mileshewitt.com/projects/lonelinessuniversity)

## To run the analysis for yourself and obtain results
Running the 'preparing..' files within '/set-up-files' and copying over the data to an excel sheet will lead you to forming a master dataset, which I have left inside the same folder. The full loneliness dataset is not attached as it is only directly available from the ONS.

All analysis undertaken and plots formed are within '/set-up-files' with respective python files that can be run.

## Data Sources
Below are the datasets used which are publicly available. This is attached in order for the work produced to be reproducible and transparent.
